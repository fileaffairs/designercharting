It is used to provide charting capabilities for utilities customers\r\nas part of their statement presentment process. Configured correctly it's possible to \r\nproduce several hundred charts per minute.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process of providing documentation and samples for the component.\r\n\r\nThe code will be provided at a later stage.\r\n\r\n## Supported Chart Types ##\r\nDesignerCharting currently supports column, stacked column, bar and stacked bar chart\r\ntypes. Additional chart types are under development.\r\n\r\n## Basic usage ##\r\nDesignerCharting is driven by binding or supplying (XML) data with two main child nodes\r\nnodes. The name of the root node for the chart can be freely chosen.\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n <chart>\r\n     <options>\r\n        ....\r\n     </options>\r\n     <dataSeries>\r\n       ...\r\n     </dataSeries>\r\n </chart>\r\n...    \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generation of the chart is done by calling the initialization and rendering within\r\nthe LiveCycle Designer events e.g. the initialize event of the DesignerCharting object\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\tDesignerCharting.init(this);\r\n\tDesignerCharting.ColumnChart.render();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code renders a ColumnChart where the data node for the chart must be bound to\r\nthe DesignerChart object. If this is not the case the reference to the data node can be\r\npassed in the init call. The example below passes a reference to a node called \r\n$data.chartData.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\tDesignerCharting.init(this, $data.chartData);\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n","name":"Designer-charting","google":""}
